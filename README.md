# postgis_3d_auxiliary_tools
Set of auxiliart tools and functions created within PostgreSQL and PostGIS to enable basic geometric operations including: 

compute the normal vector relative to a set of 3D points, conforming a plane
Find if a point is inside a tethrahedral, defined as four vertices
For a given triangle , extrude it along the normal vector at a plus  and minus a distance, later describe the tetrahedrals inside.

Iterate over a set of geometries(triangles), search points and and apply a function  for both geometries.
